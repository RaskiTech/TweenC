# TweenC

TweenC version 1.10

TweenC is a tweening library for Unity. It has all the useful functions like `.SetOnComplete` and `TweenC.Value`.

# Why to use this over other libraries?

No reason in particular. I made this library because I thought I was a cool challenge. It's as good as the other libraries, so use them if you want to.
